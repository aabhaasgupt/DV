The only other major side effect has been frequent bleeding and much heavier periods than usual.  I normally have a fairly light, short period (2 days normal bleeding, 1-2 of spotting). But there have been two occasions since starting Lyza in which I have woken up in a pool of blood on the bed because the bleeding is so heavy and unexpected. There has been some bloating as well, but I'm not sure if that is due to the pill because I had the same issue with Mirena. I have my suspicions about ovarian cysts, so that could be causing the bloating, breast tenderness, and abnormal bleeding. I rated ease of use as one star because it has been very difficult for me to remember to take the pill on time even though I set an alarm on my phone. However, it is still effective because I haven't gotten pregnant yet. I just make sure to use back up protection, or abstain for 3 days after taking a pill late.
