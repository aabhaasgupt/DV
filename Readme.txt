To run this locally, we will need to run the following on command prompt:
> cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application
> chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security

This will basically open a Google Chrome webpage with security disabled.

USE THIS ONLY IF THE NORMAL BROWSER DOESN'T WORK.
